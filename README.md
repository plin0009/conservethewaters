# Project: Conserve the Waters
A mission to raise awareness to an invaluable resource.

## Inspiration
I had no idea about the rising concern of the management of our Great Lakes. When I came to MasseyHacks, I was introduced to the many factors that are leading to the wrecking of Lake Erie. I was inspired to use my proficiency in coding to contribute to fixing our Great Lakes.

I've always had an inclination to create games, and I was enticed by the hybrid idea of game + dominant issue in society. 

## What it does
My idea is to spread awareness of an important issue through an unconventional yet powerful means.  

## How I built it
I built site with HTML and some CSS, but the majority of the site is a canvas which I used JavaScript with the Paper.js framework to access. I created the vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator CC.

## Challenges I ran into
I ran into the challenge of time, as expected. I spent time trying to implement features (eg. Facebook dialog to share the game), to no avail. Eventually, I had to prioritize my time to create other features.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I went with my vision without much difficulty.

## What I learned
I learned how to use the features of Paper.js (managing symbols, layers, importing/exporting images, etc.) because my project is essentially based on Paper.js.

Perhaps most importantly, I learned a lot about the situation of our Great Lakes. The research I did for the mission often shocked me, due to how unaware I was. 

## What's next for Conserve the Waters
24 hours is certainly not enough for me to complete the vision I have in mind. Here's a to-do list:
* Implement a built-in leader-board system
* Increase the visual appeal of the website
* Plug in more bits of information to better educate users
* Finish the Wetlands minigame
* Make sharing the site easy and efficient
* Make a section for pledges and allow users to sign for support

* Integrate Facebook Messenger's Instant Games features into the mini-games to allow for friends to play and share on Messenger
